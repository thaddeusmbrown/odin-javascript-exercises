        //Is it right to use lower case here?  I would say no, because these are constants and their variable names should be in CAPS to make it understood that these are constants

        //Solution:  we use uppercase for consts that are hardcoded, so birthday should be uppercase.  age is evaluated at runtime, so it can change depending on when the code is run.
        //for this reason, age should remain lowercase.
